# Backend

## Multi - Module Project

Our Backend is a multi module project. It sepearates the Model into to a separate module.
Then it can be reused in Service Provider Interface to implement import and
export for a log of targets. 

The xlsx target is an example that should be moved also to a separate jar in a real project
to reduce the dependendies of the core system.
